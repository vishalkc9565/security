### Concept
- Every penetration testing should be customised for each target category like ecommerse, banking etc
- functionality mapping
  - Ecommerce
    - Major
      * Security of Payment Gateway
      * Security of customer journey like validating form, location base vulnerability
      * Security of personal data
      * Security of integrity of catalogue
      * Security of service continuity (DoS)
      * Security of Traffic diversion

    - Minor ( based on targe)
      * Search bar
      * Login
      * Oauth
      * Reset password
      * pincode ( location required)
      * request a product/replace instead of product not available/ refund if product not available
      * Add to cart
      * Favourites
      * Hosted images
      * special instruction ()
      * edit profile
      * EBT snap card
  

# Recon
- CIDR: Classless Inter Domain Routing is IP address allocation method in batch for efficience
- ASN: A collection of IP and who owns them
  - RIR: AFRINC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, PIPE
- Horizontal correlation and vertical correlation

- find subdomain, IP blocks 
  - IP block + horizontal
    - arinwhois: Find IP pool ans ASN
    - mxtoolbox: CIDR using ASN
    - ipaddressguide :  to find IP range using CIDR range
    - BGP.he.net : get using ASN
    - Viewdns.info: all in one
      - reverse whois Lookup using email for horizontal correlation
      - and many more
    - lopseg.com br : all in one
    - whoxy
    - All acquistion to collect domains using chatgpt
    - nslookup to collect dns record
    - Add API keys for the subfinder and amass to get better result



- buildwith.com 
  - to collect detailed information
- amass
  - amass intel -h

## Shodan
shodan : a web browser for ethical hackers to browse non www part of internet whereas google does only www part of internet. ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFH7wNyPRjM&list=PLOJR6EhNalnu7hgxu7QhA9GrF9i23JX9A&index=8
    - create account 
    - use filter like http.title, http.status
    - open URL which have wierd title or status code like 404
    - it also give new IPs for us to explore
    - its pretty easy to search as filter can be applied with <name>:<atr> and - for negative result

## hunterhow: (small network than shodan)

## Webarchive
ref: https://archive.org/developers/wayback-cdx-server.html
- Usage
http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=<domain-name>

 - check robot/admin or something from the result



### Chaos Project Discovery
https://chaos.projectdiscovery.io : get subdomain of public bounty programs

chaos client for cli

### Manually finding subdomain
    - crt.sh 
      - %.facebook.com
    - virustotal
    - netcraft dns
    - Project discovery io chaos



### httpx-toolkit/probe to do following 
- Check domain is live or not
- Probe attribute gives the result in Pass/Fail format 
- CIDR ping
- ASN ping
- Tech stack and status code check [very important]
- Screenshot
  `httpx-toolkit -l all_subdomain.txt -t 100  -o live_subdomain_httpx_toolkit -nc -v -stats -timeout 60 -pa -fr -sc -td`

### httprobe
`cat all_subdomain.txt| httprobe -c 100 --prefer-https | anew live_domain_httprobe`


### Inscope URL
`git clone https://github.com/nil0x42/inscope`
`sudo cp inscope/inscope /usr/local/bin/`

There is `.SCOPE` file which keeps track of scope



###  Eyewitness cmd for screenshot
–timeout, -F filename, –web, –thread
`eyewitness --web -f all_live_subdomain_only --timeout 100 -d livesubdomain_screenshot_eye`


====>>>  secret information in try/hackme/readme.md



tricks:
- parametrised URL with status code 200 has most of the vulnerability
- sub-subdomain has chance of finding more bug than subdomain
- make use of server on digital ocean or aws for faster response







what is fingerprinting of subdomain
CIA triat ???
HTML template injection
web cache poisoning


task 1: try hack : pre  security
task 2: choose a target (big company, ) and gather every domain related to target and IPs
