### Concept
- Every penetration testing should be customised for each target category like ecommerse, banking etc
- functionality mapping
  - Ecommerce
    - Major
      * Security of Payment Gateway
      * Security of customer journey like validating form, location base vulnerability
      * Security of personal data
      * Security of integrity of catalogue
      * Security of service continuity (DoS)
      * Security of Traffic diversion

    - Minor ( based on targe)
      * Search bar
      * Login
      * Oauth
      * Reset password
      * pincode ( location required)
      * request a product/replace instead of product not available/ refund if product not available
      * Add to cart
      * Favourites
      * Hosted images
      * special instruction ()
      * edit profile
      * EBT snap card
  

### Recon
- CIDR: Classless Inter Domain Routing is IP address allocation method in batch for efficience
- ASN: A collection of IP and who owns them
  - RIR: AFRINC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, PIPE
- Horizontal correlation and vertical correlation

- find subdomain, IP blocks 
  - IP block + horizontal
    - arinwhois: IP block
    - mxtoolbox: CIDR using ASN
    - ipaddressguide :  to find IP range using CIDR range
    - BGP.he.net : get using ASN
    - Viewdns.info: all in one
      - reverse whois Lookup using email for horizontal correlation
      - and many more
    - lopseg.com br : all in one
    - whoxy
    - All acquistion to collect domains using chatgpt
    - nslookup to collect dns record
    - 
  - 

- buildwith.com 
  - to collect detailed information
- amass
  - amass intel -h



parametrised URL with status code 200 has most of the vulnerability

CIA triat ???
HTML template injection
web cache poisoning


task 1: try hack : pre  security
task 2: choose a target (big company, ) and gather every domain related to target and IPs
